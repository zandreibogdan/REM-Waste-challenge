# REM Waste challenge

My main goal was to redesign the cards so that they will allow for more infos to be displayed but also to mantain a balanced layout.

I decided to add a custom loading screen to the app that will be used while data is being fetched.

I tried to make the page a bit more dynamic, more predictable, and overall purposeful.
