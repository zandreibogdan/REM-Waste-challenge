## REM Waste Challenge

My main goal for this challenge was to redesign the cards so that they allow for more info to be displayed. I also wanted to add a loading screen to the page to give the user a better experience while the data is being fetched. Overall, I tried to make the UI as clean and simple as possible while still being dinamyc and purposeful.
